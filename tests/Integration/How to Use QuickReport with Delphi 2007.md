## Installing QuickReport
 
QuickReport is not included by default in Delphi 2007, but you can download it for free from the CodeGear website[^1^]. You will need to register as a Delphi user and log in to access the download link. Once you have downloaded the file, unzip it and run the setup program. Follow the instructions on the screen to install QuickReport on your computer.
 
After the installation is complete, you will need to add the QuickReport packages to your Delphi IDE. To do this, open Delphi and go to Component -> Install Packages. Click on Add and browse to the folder where you installed QuickReport (usually C:\Program Files\CodeGear\RAD Studio\5.0\Quickrpt). Select the following packages and click on Open:
 
- dclqrt50.bpl
- qrpt50.bpl
- qrpdf50.bpl

Click on OK to close the dialog box. You should now see a new tab called QuickReport on your component palette.
 
## Using QuickReport
 
To create a report using QuickReport, you will need to use a form that inherits from TQuickRep. You can either create a new form or use an existing one. To create a new form, go to File -> New -> Other and select QuickReport from the dialog box. A new form with a TQuickRep component will be created.
 
To design your report, you can use the report bands and controls that are available on the QuickReport tab of the component palette. You can drag and drop them onto your form and adjust their properties as needed. You can also use data-aware controls such as TQRDBText or TQRDBImage to display data from a dataset on your report.
 
To preview your report, you can use the Preview method of the TQuickRep component. For example, you can add a button on your form and write this code in its OnClick event:
 `
procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  QuickRep1.Preview;
end;
` 
To export your report to PDF, you can use the TQRPDFDocumentFilter component that is included with QuickReport. You will need to add it to your form and set its FileName property to the desired output file name. Then you can use the ExportToFilter method of the TQuickRep component to generate the PDF file. For example, you can add another button on your form and write this code in its OnClick event:
 `
procedure TForm1.Button2Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  QRPDFDocumentFilter1.FileName := 'test.pdf';
  QuickRep1.ExportToFilter(QRPDFDocumentFilter1);
end;
` 
You can also export your report to other formats such as HTML, RTF, CSV, etc. by using different filters that are available in QuickReport.
